    "#### 1. The dangers of early peeking in A/B testing\n",
    "\n",
    "One especially common use of hypothesis testing in data science is \"A/B testing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Many companies prioritize data informed decision making and have very mature A/B testing platforms to trial changes before adoption.  Here is an example of an A/B test which comes from the book \"Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments\" by Kohavi, Tang and Xu:\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone at your company proposes implementing a coupon code system.  To rapidly get some idea of the potential impacts even *before* implementing the complete system you decide to implement the following A/B test:  for a period of two weeks you will show half of your customers your standard checkout page (the \"control group\"), and you will show the other half a new checkout page which has a coupon code box (the \"treatment group\"). Since there are no coupon codes in existence yet, putting anything in the box will simply display \"invalid code\" and otherwise do nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will monitor how customers interact with the coupon code box (how many people click on it, enter anything into it, enter one or more attempted codes, etc), how long they stay on the checkout page in the control and treatment group, what fraction of customers who make it to the checkout page who actually complete their purchase, and the revenue per customer who made it to the checkout page.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the mere presence of a coupon code box significantly reduced revenue per customer with an effect size large enough to scuttle the project!"

    "It is common (but ill advised) for companies to **continuously** monitor such experiments and stop early when a significant result is obtained in either direction.  The reasoning is that we would not want to continue a disastrous experiment for the full planned time (e.g.  hardly anyone checks out after being presented with the coupon code box), and we would likewise not want to miss out on the benefits by **not** implementing a positive experiment as soon as possible.\n",
    "\n",

Find whatever interesting potential associations you like without worrying.  Then test one of these hypotheses on your testing set.  The downside is that your study is less powerful since you have access to only half the data.  The upside is that the data used to generate your research hypothesis is not the same data which you use to test your hypothesis (a very good thing).\n",
