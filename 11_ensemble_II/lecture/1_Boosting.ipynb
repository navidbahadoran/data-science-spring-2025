    "This week we will learn about **boosting** which address under-fitting.  While this is an oversimplification, the basic idea is that a boosted model fits sequence of models, each one trained on the residuals of the last.\n",

    "The theory behind the method is based on the concepts of <i>weak learners</i> and <i>strong learners</i> from the subfield in Statistical Learning on <i>PAC learnability</i>, here PAC stands for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning\">Probably Approximately Correct</a>. We touch lightly on the theory now."

    "### Weak learner vs strong learner\n",
    "\n",
    "Very roughly, a statistical learning algorithm is referred to as <i>weak learner</i> if it does slightly better than random guessing and is called a <i>strong learner</i> if it can be made arbitrarily close to the true relationship (given enough data).  These are the \"under-fitting models\" which we will ensemble through boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making a weak learner is much easier than producing a strong learner in general, however, it has been shown that if a problem is weak learnable (meaning that a weak learner exists) then it is strong learnable (meaning that a strong learner exists). The fact that one exists led to the creation of algorithms and techniques to produce a strong learner. This is where boosting comes into play. \n",
