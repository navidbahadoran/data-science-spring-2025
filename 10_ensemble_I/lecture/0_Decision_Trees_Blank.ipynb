    "Suppose that there are $N$ target classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gini Impurity for class $i$ of a node estimates the probability that a randomly chosen sample of class $i$ from the node is incorrectly classified as not class $i$. The formula is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G_i = p_i(1-p_i),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_i$ is the proportion of samples in the node of class $i$. The total Gini Impurity is the sum of all these $G_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_G = \\sum_{i=1}^N G_i = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i^2.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Categorical Cross-Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical cross-entropy is an alternative impurity measure you could use when building a decision tree in `sklearn`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have already discussed this metric in the `Multiclass Classification Metrics` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again suppose there are $N$ target classes. The contribution made to entropy from class $i$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_i = - p_i \\log(p_i),\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the tangent line approximation of $\\log(p)$ at $p=1$ is $(p-1)$, so  $-p\\log(p) \\approx p(1-p)$. So Gini Impurity can be seen as an approximation of categorical cross-entropy.  In practice using one or the other does not seem to impact model performance.  Computing logarithms adds a bit of computational complexity compared to squaring, so the Gini impurity could lead to a slight training time advantage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To get some intuition about \"how close\" these are, consider the 2 class case at a node with class fractions $p$ and $1-p$.  The Gini impurity is $2p(1-p)$ and the cross entropy is $-p\\log(p)+(1-p)\\log(1-p)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpret-ability :\n",
    "    - Decision Trees are known as a white box algorithm (as opposed to the black box often used to describe machine learning). This is because you are able to entirely describe how a decision tree predicts a data points target using the logic tree,\n",
    "- Very Fast Predictions and\n",
    "- Very little preprocessing of data prior to training.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Greediness:\n",
    "    - The algorithm is greedy meaning it may not create the optimal tree. For example, maybe the best tree involves an initial suboptimal cut, the CART algorithm won't find this tree.\n",
    "- Overfitting: \n",
    "    - Decision trees are very prone to overfitting the data, you can control for this using regularization hyperparameters like max_depth and min_samples_split. It's also a good idea to use cv when you can.\n",
    "- Orthogonal Boundaries:\n",
    "    - Because of the process of determining cut points (remember the $t_k$ from the algorithm?) decision boundaries happen at right angles. This means that classes divided by a non-horizontal or non-vertical line the decision tree will have some capturing the boundary. This can be mitigated a bit with PCA.\n",
    "- Sensitive:\n",
    "    - Trees are very sensitive to the training data. Removing or adding a few points can greatly change the decision boundary produced by the algorithm. One way around this is to use an averaged algorithm, like a random forest. We discuss these in a later notebook."
